Why is Green Energy Less Expensive then Fossil Fuels?
</font></b>
<br><br>
<table width=80%>
<tr>
<td>
<font size=+2>
Green energy is cheaper then fossil fuels. This might not have always been the case as fossil fuels used to be more abundant then they are now. Many different factors can go into what makes different types of energy more or less expensive. It isn't just the economy or the enviroment around that contributes to cose, but factors from both sides. The economy could be very terrible, but the enviromental factors could be fine and it could still be really expensive. Even with all factors making the price of energy greater it could still just be inflation and prices going up in general making everything more expensive. Here are some reasons that green energy is less expensive than fossil fuels:

<br>


<table width=80%>
<tr>
<td>
<font size=+1><b>
1) Green energy is more abundant. <br></b>
When we use fossil fuels we are using them up, so that they don’t come back. Although this might not have been a problem a while ago when we had access to lots of coal or natural gas, this will start to be a problem now. As we keep using them they will just run out more, making them cost more and more from year to year. It’s all about supply and demand. Green energy is a lot more abundant than fossil fuels and easier to gain access to. Chances are you already have access to big parts of green energy. We have access to the sun, used for solar energy, along with water that can be used in hydropower.

<tr>
<td>
<font size=+1><b>
2) New technology coming out every year gives us easier access to using green energy. <br></b>
As technology advances so does our knowledge of green energy and technology combined. We are finding easier ways to use green energy rather than using fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are becoming more expensive to use with the new technology coming out to generate electricity from green energy. Technology is going to keep advancing, and green energy is just going to keep becoming more advanced than fossil fuels. While fossil fuels just use old technology to make energy from them.

<tr>

<font size=+1><b>
3) Government policies are limiting our access to fossil fuels. </b><br>
Different materials grow in different countries and states, so other countries might have better access to fossil fuel materials. Our government could have a disagreement or not want to do trade with other countries that have an overabundance of fossil fuels. They could have rules or laws that limit us from getting the materials that we need over. We are going to have a harder time getting the fossil fuels over to us. Which makes it more expensive to purchase and use fossil fuels.

<tr>

<font size=+1><b>
4) An increase in the education of the people changes the market for it. </b><br>
As our knowledge of green energy and fossil fuels grows, we’ll find more efficient ways to use green energy than fossil fuels. We’ll find ways that are cheaper and more efficient. To find fossil fuels isn’t a very good process either. To find natural gas someone has to go underground and drill it deep out of the ground. This destroys the environment and puts our lives in danger. Drilling underground can also damage our houses on the surface. More people knowing about instances like this will want to switch to using green energy. As we learn more about green energy we don’t have to drill underground and destroy our environment, needing money to fix it.

<font size=+1><b>
5) The markets for coal and gas are not good. </b><br>
Since coal and natural gas are fossil fuels, they aren’t abundant like solar power or hydropower. It is very hard to get them overseas to places where they are not found. After years of a pandemic and war in places that are known to have fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, the market is way down. It’s been very hard with people being sick to transport the material we need around the world. It takes a lot more money to transport, and because of that it will now take a lot more money to sell them.

<tr>

<font size=+1><b>
6) Green energy is safer to use than fossil fuels. </b><br>
To just find some fossil fuels we have to dig far underground and bring it to the surface. Having people go very far underground where it is harder to breathe is a very dangerous process. Solar power just comes from the sun. We don’t need to do anything dangerous to get to it. It’s also safer to produce electricity from solar energy than from fossil fuels. Renewable energy prevents air pollution while fossil fuels are processed with toxic ingredients and let out into the air. These gases will get trapped in the environment and can cause climate change. Using fossil fuels and causing these problems is just causing more money to fix. We have to put money into repairing underground areas or money if someone gets hurt underground.

Costs of Green Energy
</font></b>
<br><br>
<table width=80%>
<tr>
<td>
<font size=+1>
One major concern of many homeowners is what the cost of green and clean energy is. The following information walks through the cost of providing this type of energy in your own house and providing it for the nation as a tax paying citizen. 
<br><br>
The cost for different types of clean energies all depends on the state you live in, the amount of watages you plan to use, and the company you buy from. Solar Panels for example range from $17,430 to $23,870. Another example is owning a small group of wind turbines for home use will be approximately $15,000 to $75,000 for having 5 to 15 kW of power capacity. Research your options before investing to find the best cost effective investment for your situation.

How to Lower the Expenses

Stay informed about tax rebate information. Many government and green energy sites release updated information about benefits provided by the government for homeowners who invest in clean and green energy solutions for their homes. These tax credits are known as the ITC and PTC, and they will be further explained in the next section of this page.
<br><br>
Research for possible clean and cost efficient alternative options. If you want to use solar energy consider looking into outdoor solar lights for walkways and porches. Their installation is easy and their cost is low. Another simple way to use solar energy at a cheaper price is getting a solar portable charger. They will restore energy to your device when out in the sun and their price is around $15.
<br><br>
Look into your electric bills and see what you can easily change. One that comes highly recommended is switching to a solar water heater. A normal water heater uses around $440 dollars of electricity per year and a solar water heater costs $250 to $1,200. Another possibility is connecting certain appliances to green energy generators. Both of these solutions will save you lots of money in a couple years time without the large expense of fully switching. It’s a great starting point for you as a homeowner to see what switching to clean energy will look like for you.

What is ITC and PTC?</font></b><a name="iTP"></a>

ITC and PTC are the two types of tax credit options for those investing in green energy solutions. They are available for certain projects, but one project is not able to receive both types of credits. We encourage you to research both of these options to see which type of credit is best for your project
<br><br>
ITC will provide owners with 30% of the value of their project. The IRS released a statement saying, “The Residential Clean Energy Credit equals 30% of the costs of new, qualified clean energy property for your home installed anytime from 2022 through 2032”. This is for any home owner who invests in clean energy solutions for their home, and it encourages homeowners to make the investment
<br><br>
PTC awards credit based on the amount of watages a clean energy source is used for in a home. Evergreen Action writes, “For every kWh of clean energy generated, the producer gets a base credit of 2.6¢/kWh (again, provided they meet certain labor standards). Historically that’s been roughly equivalent in value to the 30 percent ITC”. This is for any owner of a green energy source that regularly produces watages of energy, and it is meant to encourage users to produce more clean energy instead of relying on other sources.
