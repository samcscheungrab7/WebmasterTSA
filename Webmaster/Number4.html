<br>People switch to green energy solutions because of the many benefits they offer household owners. These benefits cover a large range of problems that our society commonly face today, which is why they are often compelling reasons for citizens to switch to green energy. Here are some of the most common positive reasons for you to consider the switch.

<li>One of the main reasons is how environmentally friendly these energies are, these resources will not impact global warming like fossil fuels. This is because, unlike fossil fuels, green energy solutions do not emit toxic fumes that cause pollution. They also do not release as much carbon dioxide as fossil fuels, which are less harmful to living things. The United Nations stated, “It could decarbonize 90 percent of the power sector by 2050, massively cutting carbon emissions and helping to mitigate climate change.” and the American Clean Power Association wrote, “Clean energy avoids 438 million tons of CO2 emissions every year”.
</li><br>
<li>Second, having green energy means that our energy sources would never run out. Right now many of our energy sources rely on resources that we only have a limited supply of such as oil, natural gas, and coal. MET writes,” It is predicted that we will run out of fossil fuels in this century. Oil can last up to 50 years, natural gas up to 53 years, and coal up to 114 years”.But green energy uses resources that are constantly naturally replenished such as water, wind, and sunlight. Switching to these types of resources will be crucial in being able to continue providing power to citizens.
</li><br><img src="bene.jpeg" hspace=10 align=right width=900 height=600>
<li>Another benefit would be that these energies would increase our country's economic independence. This is because we would no longer have to rely on other countries for resources such as oil. This independence would also help communities in America not have to rely on the government for their energy needs. This independence could be revolutionary for minorities who are forced to live in poor conditions because of their lack of income and resulting location.
</li><br>
<li>Also, switching to green energy will result in economic development. This change will create jobs in manufacturing, installation and more. The International Labor Organization released on September 22, 2022 that there are 12.7 million jobs related to renewable energy globally. They informed that the largest sector of growth is with solar energy, but since this is the most developed and well known type of energy, there are expectations of growth in many other types of green energy as they progress.
</li><br>
<li>Furthermore, converting to this type of energy would increase public health. There would be a decrease in emission resulting in cleaner air, water, and soil. All of this results in better health. Good air quality also will help the temperature and humidity, causing a decrease in mold for homeowners.

<br>Green energy is usually only known for the many benefits it can provide a home owner, but there are many harms that homeowners should consider. These disadvantages show there is another side to green energy, and to consider both arguments before converting.

<li>An obvious harm would be that this type of energy is not available around the clock. All of these types of energy require perfect weather conditions, so when there is a disaster and energy is required, there would be none for a homeowner to access. For solar energy specifically, after 4-9 pm, known as peak time or when the sun sets, solar panels can no longer collect energy.
</li><br>
<li> Another issue is that the efficiency for this technology is down up to 45% due to how long it takes for energy to be converted into electricity. Experts say you require 4-5 hours of sunlight a day to produce enough energy from solar panels, and that’s only if there is good non-cloudy weather. Plus high-speed internet data will not be possible due to the amount of time it takes for the collected energy to be turned into electricity.
</li><br><img src="harm.jpeg" hspace=10 align=right width=500 height=700>
<li>Moreover the initial cost for these energies for a homeowner is more expensive than most people can afford. Though many people argue that the overall investment will be cost efficient over time, the upfront charge is more than what most Americans can afford. Energy.gov writes, “Forty-four percent of Americans, or about 50 million people, qualify as low-income and have a disproportionately high energy burden; this means the percentage of gross household income they spend on energy is three times higher than it is for non-low-income Americans. This disparity stands in the way of nationwide energy accessibility and affordability”.
</li><br>
<li>Also these types of resources can only collect their energy at certain locations, for example wind farms need to be located in very windy areas such as higher ground and ocean energy must be located in places with good currents, where in contrast fossil fuels can conduct energy anywhere. 
</li><br>
<li> Additionally, a lot of space is required for these types of energies in order to acquire enough energy. Each windmill requires a certain amount of distance from one another in order to not interfere with each other and the amount of solar panels necessary for a large building like a factory or school would take up a whole field. Elements by Visual Capitalist explain, “According to a report from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, roughly 22,000 square miles of solar panel-filled land (about the size of Lake Michigan) would be required to power the entire country, including all 141 million households and businesses, based on 13-14% efficiency for solar modules”.
